Experiments in Machine Learning with Cones
==========================================

Questions to investigate:
 - How do performance and speed compare to SVM, Naive Bayes and
   other classifiers?
 - How does it work on different datasets?
 - How does performance vary as we increase number of dimensions?
 - How do the four implementations vary in accuracy and speed?
 - How does performance vary as we increase amount of data?
